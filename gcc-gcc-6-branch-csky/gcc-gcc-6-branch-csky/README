		   Configure for csky gcc

Basic linux gcc configuration:
  ./configure [HOST_TARGET] --enable-languages=c --target=[TARGET] --with-cskyabi=[ABI VERSION] --without-headers --with-newlib --enable-shared --disable-libssp --disable-libgomp --disable-libmudflap --with-sysroot=[SYSROOT DIRECTORY]  --prefix=[PREFIX]
HOST_TARGET is the host to execute binutils, such as x86_64-linux.
TARGET can choose one of csky-abiv2-linux,csky-linux. 
ABI VERSION is abiv1 or abiv2.
If you want to build no multilib gcc, you should add:
  --disable-multilib --with-cpu=[CPU] --with-endian=[ENDIAN] --with-float=[FLOAT VERSION]
CPU is one of csky cpu models, such as ck810f.
ENDIAN is big or little.
FLOAT VERSION is hard or soft.
If c++ is needed, build the libc fisrt, and add following to configuration.
  --enable-languages=c,c++ --enable-threads=posix --with-lib=[LIBC DIRECTORY] --with-headers=[LIBC HEADER DIRECTORY] --with-build-sysroot=[SYSROOT DIRECTORY] --enable-poison-system-directories --with-build-time-tools=[INSTALL DIRECTORY/bin]

This directory contains the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

The GNU Compiler Collection is free software.  See the files whose
names start with COPYING for copying permission.  The manuals, and
some of the runtime libraries, are under different terms; see the
individual source files for details.

The directory INSTALL contains copies of the installation information
as HTML and plain text.  The source of this information is
gcc/doc/install.texi.  The installation information includes details
of what is included in the GCC sources and what files GCC installs.

See the file gcc/doc/gcc.texi (together with other files that it
includes) for usage and porting information.  An online readable
version of the manual is in the files gcc/doc/gcc.info*.

See http://gcc.gnu.org/bugs/ for how to report bugs usefully.

Copyright years on GCC source files may be listed using range
notation, e.g., 1987-2012, indicating that every year in the range,
inclusive, is a copyrightable year that could otherwise be listed
individually.
